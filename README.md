## About
Codio is a media format for recording the process of programming.

The format is composed of operations on a code editor and audio/video.

A codio recorder allows you to record the proccess of programming inside an IDE.

A codio player will play that recording inside another IDE.

## Why?

Codio was created out of a desire to imporve learning infrastructure.

Communication tools are core to learning.

Codio aims to be a medium upon creating explorable and interactive communications can happen effortlessly.

## Usecases

Codio is a new media format. A new media format enables a new medium of communication. As with every new medium, the actual use cases that will succeed are hard to predict.

Here are a few that seem reasonable:

### Tutorials

Recording tutorials in codio is the easiest way to make your tutorial explorable and interactive.

Being able to play a recording inside an IDE means that the learner can always pause and interact with the code.

It also means he can use his own tools and environment immediately.

### Messaging

Codio opens a completely new way of async communication between prgorammers. Recording codio messages is effortless and codio messages contain a lot of information.

### Documentation
Codio could be used to enhance code by appending codio tutorials to specific functions or libraries.
